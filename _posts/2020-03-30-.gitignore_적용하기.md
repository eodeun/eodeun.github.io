### .gitignore 적용하기

Even if you haven't tracked the files so far, Git seems to be able to "know" about them even after you add them to .gitignore.

WARNING: First commit your current changes, or you will lose them.

Then run the following commands from the top folder of your Git repository:

'''git bash
git rm -r --cached .  
git add .  
git commit -m "fixed untracked files"  
'''
